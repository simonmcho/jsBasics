# jsBasics  
## Goals
The purpose for this repository is to show JavaScript concepts and for me to practice these concepts.

## How to get started:
- Install npm
- run any of the .js files that have console.log in the program using `node <file_name_here>.js`  
**js files that don't have console.log in the program will be updated by the end of this year**
  
### Status: WIP
To Do:  
- Practice prototypes and inheritance (remember concepts from Java)
- Private properties using closures
- Hoisting (get more advanced)
- Currying
- Apply, call, bind methods (get more advanced)
- Event delegation, bubbling and capturing
- Bubble Sort (OOP concept)
- Memoization
- Method overloading (again from OOP concepts)
- Promises
